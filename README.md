### Hi there, I'm Japroz (`0x6a6170726f7a`) Singh Saini

I'm a 16 y/o (as of 2021) student from India and my aim is to be a software engineer at [`NASA JPL`](https://jpl.nasa.gov). I love to code in `C,C++` and `Typescript` (i know, its a weird combo) and build low level software.

## Projects that I've contributed to
- [`plausible/analytics`](https://github.com/plausible/analytics)

## Technologies
